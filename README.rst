``eventyay`` is a conference planning tool focused on providing the best
experience for organisers, speakers, reviewers, and attendees alike.  It
handles the submission process with a configurable Call for Participation, the
reviewing and selection of submissions, and the scheduling and release
handling. After the event, ``eventyay`` allows speakers to receive feedback,
upload their slides, and organisers to embed recordings.

Read our `feature list`_ on our main site to get a better idea of what
`eventyay` can do for you, but it typically involves everything you'll need to
curate submissions and contents for a conference with several tracks and
conference days.

You can host eventyay yourself, as detailed in our `administrator
documentation`_, or use our public instance at `eventyay.com`_. If you want to
use eventyay, we recommend you follow `our blog`_, where we announce new
versions and upcoming features.
