Administrator documentation
===========================

You want to install eventyay on your own server? Thatâ€™s great! We have
documentation for a standard installation using pip in an unprivileged local
user account.

If you want a more out-of-the-box way of running eventyay, please consider our
hosted version at `eventyay.com`_. Other than that, we also have an
`ansible role`_ and a community-provided `docker-compose setup`_. Please
note that the docker setup is not officially supported.
